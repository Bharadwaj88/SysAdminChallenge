Answer the following with as much detail as you are comfortable, and email your answers to the contact who pointed you here.

- You are free to assume any technique/technology you think relevant can be used to solve the given problem.
- State all assumptions in describing your solution

Q1: You have been given 1000 nodes to bootstrap, how would you go about installing OS on these nodes?  Assume all 1000 nodes have been wired etc.  How much time would it take ? (what if we had 10000 nodes)

Q2: How would you implement a system that distributes a file to 1000 nodes? (Any changes if 10000 nodes ?)

Q3: How would you install hadoop/elasticsearch/cassandra (whatever distributed software you're familiar with) and test/check?

Q4: How would you prevent unauthorized access to the cluster resources? (Assume cluster service does not have intrinsic authentication / authorization built in)
